# Fake-News-Project
Problem:  With the fast global world we have news streaming fast between all social networks and to online news websites, where the competition is measuring who will get it faster and better. Naturally fake news was a by-product of that situation and by other factors (such as political interests etc). 

Goal: Create an automatic tool based on machine and deep learning that will classify every new item if itâ€™s a True/False news. The tool can be added to every online newspaper (Ynet for example) or any social network that wants to invalidate fake news  for increasing their credibility to their audience. 

Steps: 
1. Data - Find the most fitted data to answer our problem. The criteria for that will be:<br /> 
  a. Label -  labeling false and true<br />
  b. Enough amount of data<br />
  c. Data collected from multiple subjects (politics, economics etc)<br /> 
  d. Have a test data - so we can test our models on it before production<br />
2. EDA -  Cleaning, fixing, exploring and getting the initial insights 
3. Modeling testing  - testing types of modeling and analyze the results
4. Select the winning model 
5. Create pipeline and run the test data 
6. Summarize  - results, insights, conclusion and future plans<br />
  a. Testing classification models vs neural network models <br />
  b. What business conclusions - how should we measure our model on the business side
